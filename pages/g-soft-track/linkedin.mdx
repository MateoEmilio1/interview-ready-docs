# Preparando el Linkedin


## ‚úÖ Checklist

- Imagery
- []  Cover Pictures are not important
- []  **DO NOT** use employer provided imagery. They signal an unwillingness to leave your current employer.
- [ ]  Your profile picture **must be present**
    - [ ]  A professional shoot is not necessary, but the image has to be formal
    - [ ]  Do not use inappropriate imagery like bars, parties, vacations
    - [ ]  Do not include family members, friends, or kids in your profile picture
    - [ ]  Use a crips high-quality image.
- Copy
  - [ ] Resumes ** Must be in  English **
  - [ ]  Write a short tagline that sums up your profile (ie. Experienced Fintech BE engineer, Fullstack Tech Lead in Health, etc)
  - [ ]  Please do not spam your tagline with technology stacks, it dilutes your profile
  - [ ]  Write an updated description - it must answer two questions. What you can do and what you want to do.
  - [ ]  What are the roles you can perform - backend, frontend, full-stack, etc
  - [ ]  What are your aspirations and industry levels - Lead, Manager, Director, etc
  - [ ]  What stacks are you proficient in or could work with (Languages, Frameworks)
  - [ ]  What industries do you know or want to join
  - [ ]  Avoid cliches and fluff - ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always looking for opportunities‚Äù, ‚ÄúI like learning‚Äù, ‚ÄúI like traveling‚Äù
  - [ ]  **Do not use ChatGPT under any circumstance.** You will be penalized heavily by both the platform and recruiters.
  - [ ]  Do not use promotional content for your employer
  - [ ]  Add your email in your description or profile. This makes it easier for recruiters to contact you. You can create a custom email for LinkedIn if you want more privacy.
  - [ ]  Verify all the text you write with Grammarly or a similar tool. Typos and grammar issues signal poor communication skills.
  - [ ]  Do not use the green ‚ÄúOpenToWork‚Äù banner. It signals being unable to pass interview processes and desperation. You can still put yourself OpenToWork for recruiters without making it so public.
    
- Work Experience
  - [ ] Emphasize the last 5 years of work experience.
  - [ ] Job positions with old stacks and products do not add to your profile but might subtract.
  - [ ] Do not add short positions < 6 months, they do more harm than help.
  - [ ]  Ensure dates on all listed positions make sense
    - [ ]  Avoid overlapping dates. Do not put side-gigs or second jobs in your history - they invite uncomfortable questions
  - [ ]  The title of each position should be tailored to your active search, not to the company's official title. (If you are looking for a backend python position, write backend python, not ‚Äúsoftware engineer‚Äù if that‚Äôs how the company calls it)
  - [ ]  Add a description of your accomplishments and responsibilities to each of your job positions.
    - [ ]  Avoid fluff, buzzwords, and generalities.
    - [ ]  Each addition should prove one of 3 points: your capacity to lead, to solve complex and hard technical challenges, or to help the bottom line of the company. Anything else is useless.
    - [ ]  Use precise language (I helped the company make 200k/yr with X Project).
    - [ ]  Do not write platitudes or expected day-to-day work. (‚ÄúI helped run meetings‚Äù, ‚ÄúI wrote unit tests‚Äù)
  - [ ]  Use the ‚Äútop skills‚Äù feature related to job positions to enhance your profile.
- Education
    - [ ]  Place education at the bottom of the resume, not at the top.
    - [ ]  Do not emphasize or even mention being an engineering student. The technical evaluation is done separately, don‚Äôt announce to the world that you wouldn‚Äôt pass it by emphasizing your lack of experience.
    - [ ]  Do not emphasize dropping out of college. Nobody cares.

- Tips & Tricks
  - LinkedIn Verification
    - [ ]  It's hard to quantify the impact, but you are likely getting boosted in recruiter searches with it.
    - [ ]  In Argentina, you need a recent valid passport to go through the process
- Red Flags üö©üö©üö©
    - [ ]  Bad Titles: ‚ÄúMid/Middle developer‚Äù or ‚ÄúSSR developer‚Äù
    - [ ]  Bad emails: ‚Äúhotmail‚Äù and ‚Äúoutlook‚Äù.
